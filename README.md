# Challenge of the week F.W.W.D:

![alt text](/passwordDesign.jpeg "PasswordRevealer")

Create or reveal PasswordRevealer where the user can click on an icon to show / hide the password.

The user can see the strength of the password according to the emojis.

A rule for password strength will be simple.

1. 1-3 characters = BAD
2. 4-6 characters = MEDIUM
3. Above 7 characters = GOOD

Password strength should be automatic as the user types. Or, when a password reaches character 4, or the emoji should change and so on.

The end result should remain exactly the same as the image, shape, color, spaces, etc.

Requirements: implement using javascript and class.

BEST OF LUCK!
